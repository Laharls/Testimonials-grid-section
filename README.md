## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to appreciate CSS Grid. I'll start to use it more often than Flexbox

### Continued development

I will continue to practice CSS Grid, to make a better use of it, and use both Flexbox and Grid instead of only using Flexbox.
